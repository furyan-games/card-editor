# Card Editor
Card Editor is a tool meant for a game we're developing.

As we are representing events in that game as cards, we need a tool to create cards rather easily and with low chance of error.

Currently it is a work-in progress and we chose no license yet. Basically, copy whatever you wish as long as you don't plan to license any of it under a license that restricts source copying.
